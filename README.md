# Print Your Smile — Funnel Snippets (ClickFunnels 2.0)

This repo holds **paste-ready HTML/JS blocks** and minimal CSS you can drop into **ClickFunnels 2.0**.

## Paste map (where code goes in ClickFunnels)
- **Components (sticky bar, modal, accordions):** add an **Elements → Custom JS/HTML** block and paste the file from `/snippets/...`.
- **Global helpers (UTM capture, small utilities):** **Settings → Tracking Code**
  - **Header** for helpers that must run early (e.g., UTM capture).
  - **Footer** for behaviors that can wait for the DOM.
